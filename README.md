# 🚛 An Investigation Into the Use of IoTs to Automate the Operation of the NSWMA

<br>

## 📝 Description
A Major Project research-only project conducted at the University of Technology, Jamaica. The project analyzed operational inefficiencies in 
Jamaica's National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) and proposed IoT-based solutions to enhance garbage collection processes. 
Responsibilities included: Conducting quantitative and qualitative research via surveys and interviews with NSWMA employees, Designing and evaluating IoT-driven strategies, 
such as smart bins and real-time data analytics, for optimized route planning and resource allocation, Assessing technical challenges, cost implications, and potential environmental benefits and Drafting 
comprehensive findings and recommendations for implementing IoT technologies in waste management operations. This initiative highlighted the practical application of IoT in addressing real-world operational challenges, 
improving resource management, and fostering sustainability in public systems.
